# Zsh-scripts
A personal learning repository of my Zsh scripts to have and to keep a record, to amass a library of problem-solving, technique and facility in the language, and to keep apples with apples. It may or may not be useful to anyone else.

# Learning aims and coding paradigms and design philosohy 
My learning aims and personal take on shell scripting design philosophy, is to code in Zsh in the paradigms, style and rigor of Pascal, in order to bring a legibility, structure and elegance to the code. I aim to learn Bash and Zsh scripting in relation to each other, as I understand that so doing engenders deep learning and assists in the comprehesion of complex abstract concepts through metaphorical extension, as per the science of pedagogical theory.

# Learning Bash and Zsh in unison, applying the principles of Pascal
Bash and Zsh have some similarities and differences with Pascal, and I aim to exploit and maximise these principles, paradigms and techniques to script with precision and intentionality. 

# Coding design aims
I aim to:

		* use subroutines to organise code into logical units
		* use control structures to control the flow of execution
		* use strong typing and explicit casting when dealing with different data types
		* use meaningful names, clear and readable code, and data structures
		* use efficient and elegant algorithms to solve problems
  
Thus endeth the manifesto!
